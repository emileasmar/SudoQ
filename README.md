# SudoQ Solver

In summary, my role in the Sudoku Solver project involved a variety of image processing techniques. Starting from loading the image, I handled grayscale conversion, black and white conversion using Otsu's method, contrast enhancement, and image rotation, all of which were fundamental in the success of our Sudoku Solver.
